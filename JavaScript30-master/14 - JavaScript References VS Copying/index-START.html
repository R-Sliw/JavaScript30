      // start with strings, numbers and booleans

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players;

      //team[3] = "twojaStara";

      console.log(players, team);

      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      const team2 = players.slice(1, 2);
      console.log(team2);
      console.log(players);

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      // or use the new ES6 Spread

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:

      const new_Person = person;
      //new_Person.number = 99;

      //console.log(new_Person);
      console.log(person);

      // how do we take a copy instead?

      const capt2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 22, age: 12 });

      console.log(person);
      console.log(capt2);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // const cap3 = {...person};
      // // console.log(cap3);

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      const wes = {
        name: "Wes",
        age: 100,
        social: {
          twitter: "@wesbos",
          facebook: "wesbos.developer",
        },
      };

      console.clear();

      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));

      dev2.social.twitter = "demon";

      console.log(dev2);
